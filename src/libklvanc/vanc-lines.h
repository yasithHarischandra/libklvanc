 * @brief	Routines for managing VANC lines containing one or more VANC packets.
 *
 *              These routines allow a caller to take VANC packets and assemble a frame
 *              composed of a group of VANC lines.  This includes:
 *              1.  Ensuring no VANC packets with a given line/offset will overlap (moving VANC packets if necessary)
 *              2.  Ensuring there are no gaps between VANC packets
 *              3.  Ensuring the sum of all VANC packets does not overflow the line length
 *              4.  Ensuring there are no illegal values in the VANC payload at a physical level
